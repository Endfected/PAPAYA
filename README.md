These are the files for the Papaya. It is a foam dart blaster powered by flywheels. "Loosely" based on the PPSH-41, hence the name. It was formerly known as "Project Double Chin" but that was a far stretch and no one would get it. 

Currently a WIP and very early files. Expect many changes and to do filing/sanding to fit parts together if you do decide to print them.


FEATURES

Two stage trigger
Large battery stock designed to fit a 7.4V NiMH pack
Mag release that pivots like on the PPSH
STEP files included!


PRINTING/ASSEMBLY

All parts fit on an Ender 3 sized print bed. Approximately 220 x 220 x 250 MM

Many parts will need supports. Most can probably be printed at 20% infill as they aren't load bearing. Please let me know of any problems you have. I expect fitment to be a big one as these have no built in tolerances to account for different printers.

This blaster is designed to use the straight talon flycore by OldFusionDesigns. It requires all the heat seat inserts and a new mag release print. It uses standard size wheels and should work with all of them. You can find the flycore here: https://www.printables.com/model/286951-ofd-flycore-straight-talon-design-your-next-printe

Assembly should be straight forward. Most screws are the 4-40s unless going into the flycore itself, which are M3. The battery stock also takes an M3 nut and (thumb)screw. The switches are mounted using nerf sized screws. The mag lever is hinged on an M3 screw and nut as well as the trigger.

HARDWARE

Many Flat Head Screws, 4-40 Thread Size, 3/8" length (the same ones that the Sillybutts SLAB uses)
M3 screws, length unknown currently. You will need ~9. I recommend getting one of those variety M3 sets as they are generally pretty helpful
Pen springs???
2 10A Cherry DB2 short-arm roller microswitches
Some nerf shell screws ~6
Flywheels- this was designed with full size flywheels in mind. It should work with all of them. I plan to run daybreaks.
Flycore parts
Nerf faux barrel 25 CM. I got mine from OutofDarts. Its the "Worker Threaded Barrel Tube (Multiple Sizes & Colors)"
Possibly an M3 thumbscrew or another M3 screw for the battery cover.
M3 nut
Wires duh
